<h1>Cub3D</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cub3D is a raycasting project that simulates a 3D view using a 2D grid map, similar to how early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D worked.
The aim is to create a first-person environment using only:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A 2D map</li>
	<li>Raycasting to determine visibility</li>
	<li>A graphical library (MiniLibX) for rendering</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Steps for compilation, installation, and execution:</p>
<li>Clone the repository/li>

```
git clone https:/...
```
<li>Enter the repository</li>

```
cd Cub3D
```
<li>To compile, we simply write</li>

```
make
```
<li>If you want to compile with the bonus, add the flag below</li>

```
make bonus
```

<li>Finally, to run the program, write the following</li>

````
./Cub3D scene.cub
or
./Cub3D_bonus scene.cub
````
<li>From the commands above, choose based on whether you compiled with the bonus rule or not.</li>

<h2>Controls</h2>
<li>W/A/S/D: Move forward/left/backward/right.</li>
<li>←/→ Arrow Keys: Rotate view left/right.</li>
<li>ESC: Close the window.</li>

<p>The use of AI has been employed as a means to resolve doubts during the development of the project in situations where clear explanations could not be found.</p>
